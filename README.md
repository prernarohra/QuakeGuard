# :earth_africa: Earthquake Intensity Minimizer 

Minimize the shake, Maximize the safety

## :clipboard: Overview

The Earthquake Intensity Minimizer is an AI-based web application designed to minimize earthquake intensity, reducing potential loss of life and damage. The application uses machine learning algorithms to accurately predict earthquake intensity and mitigate its effects, thereby improving readiness for seismic disasters. The project also includes cooperative insurance plans that cover earthquake-related damage.

## :bar_chart: Dataset

The dataset includes five key features: "Intensity" (the dependent feature), "Magnitude," "Victim reaction," "Destruction," and "Depth" (the independent features). The intensity is measured purely based on the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale. Extensive research was conducted to ensure that these four independent features are the most impactful in predicting earthquake intensity, making them ideal for inclusion in this dataset. 

## :sparkles: Features

- **Intensity Prediction**: It Uses machine learning algorithms to predict earthquake intensity with good accuracy.
- **Intensity Minimization**: It aims to reduce the impact of earthquakes by three famous japanese standards.
- **Insurance Plans**: Offers multiple cooperative insurance plans to help cover earthquake-related damage.
