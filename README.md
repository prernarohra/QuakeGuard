# Earthquake Intensity Minimizer
**Minimize the shake, Maximize the safety**

It predicts the intensity of an earthquake and mitigate it's impact using ML algorithms.

## Overview

The Earthquake Intensity Minimizer is an AI-based web application designed to minimize earthquake intensity, reducing potential loss of life and damage. The application leverages machine learning algorithms to accurately predict earthquake intensity and mitigate its effects, thereby improving readiness for seismic disasters. The project also includes cooperative insurance plans that cover earthquake-related damage.
